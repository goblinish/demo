    Cyclone Chapala was a powerful tropical cyclone that hit Yemen and brushed Somalia in November 2015. The third named storm of the 2015 North Indian Ocean cyclone season, it developed as a depression on 28 October off western India, and strengthened a day later into a cyclonic storm. On 30 October, the India Meteorological Department estimated Chapala's peak three-minute sustained winds at 215 km/h (130 mph). The Joint Typhoon Warning Center estimated one-minute sustained winds of 240 km/h (150 mph), making Chapala one of the strongest cyclones on record in the Arabian Sea. Chapala skirted the Yemeni island of Socotra on 1 November, becoming the first hurricane-force storm there since 1922. Upon entering the Gulf of Aden on 2 November, it became the strongest known cyclone in that body of water. After brushing Somalia, the storm made landfall on 3 November, near Mukalla, Yemen, as a very severe cyclonic storm. It was the strongest storm on record to strike Yemen, where eight people died.
